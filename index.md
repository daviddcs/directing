## Brevity TRACK

* OUTLAW - Informative  call  that  a  bogey  has  met  point  of  origin  criteria.

(Color  may  indicate  additional  standoff  distance.)    Follow  briefed procedures.
* GOPHER - A  bogey  that  has  not  conformed  to  safe  passage  routing,  airspeed,  or  altitude procedures.  Will  only  be  used  when  safe  passage  or  minimum  risk  routing  procedures  are  part  of an ID matrix.
* LEAKERS - Airborne  threat  has  passed  through  a  defensive  layer.    Call  should  include amplifying  information.
* FADED - Radar  contact  (temporally)  is  lost  on  a  non-friendly  aircraft/surface  contact  and  any positional  information  given  is  estimated.
* POPUP GROUP - Equals THREAT call, follow up with BRAA. 
* NO  FACTOR - Not  a  threat.
* GROUP - Aircraft  within  3  NM  in  azimuth  or  range.
* HEAVY - A  group  or  package  known  to  contain  three  or  more  entities.
* FAST - Target  speed  is  estimated  to  be  600  to  900  knots  ground  speed/Mach  1  to  1.5.
* HIGH - Target  is  between  25,000  and  40,000  feet  MSL.
* MEDIUM - Target  altitude  between  10,000  and  25,000  feet  MSL. 
* LOW  -Target  altitude  is  below  10,000  feet  MSL.
* MANEUVER (AZIMUTH/RANGE/ALTITUDE) - Informative  call  that  said  group  is maneuvering  in  azimuth,  range,  and/or  altitude.
* OPENING - Increasing  in  range.
* LAST - Command  and  control  (C2)  term  that  provides  the  last  contact  altitude  from  a  high fidelity  source  (fighter  radar).
* PINCE  -Threat  maneuvering  for  a  bracket  attack.


## Brevity General

* **FATHER** - Shipboard  tactical  air  navigation  (TACAN)  station.

* LEAN (direction) - Directive/informative  call  to  maneuver  in  a  direction  to  avoid  the  threat.
* MERGE(D) - Informative  call  that  friendlies  and  targets  have  arrived  in  the  same  visualarena.    Call  indicating  radar  returns  have  come  together.
* NEW  PICTURE - Used  by  controller  or  aircrew  when  tactical  picture  has  changed.Supersedes  all  previous  calls  and  re-establishes  picture  for  all  players.
* OFFSET  (w/direction) - Informative  call  indicating  maneuver  in  a  specified  direction  with reference  to  the  target.
* PIGEONS - Magnetic  bearing  and  range  to  HOMEPLATE.
* PITCH/PITCHBACK  (LEFT/RIGHT) - Directive  call  for  fighter  or  flight  to  execute  a nose-high  heading  reversal.
* SLICE/SLICEBACK  (LEFT/RIGHT) - Directive  call  for  fighter  or  flight  to  execute  a nose-low  heading  reversal.
(freq)
* POGO  (freq) - Switch  to  communication  channel  number  preceding  POGO. If  unable to  establish  communications,  switch  to  channel  number  following  POGO.    If  no  channel  number follows  POGO,  return  to  this  channel.


## Brevity FIGHTER
